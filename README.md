# mahjong

Mahjong is a tile card game that requires players to satisfy certain conditions in order to declare a win.

Different groups and places use different rules, so we often have to learn new rules every time we play with new people. 

This game is created using the rules that my family created. As my sister and I have grown up, it gets harder and harder to play in person together. I decided to start this project so we can play with each other from anywhere in the world.
